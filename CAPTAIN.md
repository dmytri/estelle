# Captain Notes

Binding behaviour lives in `.feature` specs and referenced `assets/**`. History lives in git. These notes carry only what the next cycle needs.

## Current voyage 2026-07-09: audit remediation

Upstream audit found: lint gate red (4 `noNonNullAssertion` in `src/index.ts`, now a binding lint-clean scenario in `methodology-conformance.feature`), 7 `@captain` skeletons (all promoted by the operator, the live-crew one tagged `@eval`), `@eval` tier unconfirmed against upstream 0.10.1 (a mis-scoped run saw 4 failures including a `spawn ENOENT` on the upstream shipshape clone's `bash-custody.sh`; needs live triage), and the standing refit deltas below. `@logic` proper confirmed green, 126/126 in 56s.

## Standing Estelle deltas, apply at next harbour refit

Upstream is now `0.10.1`; `/shipwright` re-derives to current shape and drops superseded slots:

- `## Outbound` reshapes to `outbound` / `ship` / `verify` lines per target.
- `## Dependencies` reshapes to one `dependency:` line per name; the `runtime:`/`dev:` keys are superseded.
- `## Tiers` moves per-tier policy to `policy:` lines and gains an optional `weather:` path for the wake's weather record; Estelle is the named weather-record pilot, and per-scenario duration lands there during the boundary check.
- `## Known false-failure modes` reshapes to `mode:` lines, and the entries must drop procedure ("QM should isolate...") to stay values-only.
- Declare `scantlings:` under `## Directories` for `assets/scantlings/` (`internal-api-shape.d.ts` is live and undeclared).
- 0.10.1 also changed hook behaviour Estelle consumes live: planks-check scopes to crew/shipwright, dispatch-guard binds a spawned Captain and measures the prompt, feature-quality exempts `# language:` and doc-string hashes. The shim's custody assertions must be re-proven against these.
- Open follow-up: the shim consuming the `rules/` component is now safer to pilot; 0.10.1 rewrote the rules as faithful cited checklists under test.

## What Estelle is (reoriented 2026-07-04)

Estelle is three things at once, all resting on faithfully consuming the real Shipshape plugin, never a fork of it:

1. **Reference runtime** for running Shipshape (skills + open-plugin) on pi.
2. **Live-fire pilot** that produces the evidence the maintainer's note asks for: what enforces on pi, what fumbles, every false red and vacuous green.
3. **A great coding agent** in its own right: Bonny and the crew personas, `/embark`, `/clear`, alongside-crew UX, per-seat models, fitting-out.

## Monorepo

`@dk/estelle` (scoped flagship) at root; unscoped extension packages under `packages/`, consumed via `workspace:*`. One root Shipshape harness: root `cucumber.cjs`, `RIGGING.md`, `tsconfig.json` cover `packages/*`. `packages/pi-open-plugin-shim` is pi's open-plugin engine; pi is not hook-native, so the shim executes the neutral `.plugin/` hooks on pi events. `SubagentStop` and the `Task` matcher have no pi equivalent: pi is session-isolated, not subagent-isolated. Pilot finding.

## Standing rules

- **Pre-1.0: no backward compatibility, no compat cruft.** Current design only. Old forms are Shipwright's to refit, never a parser's to tolerate.
- A change to a SHARED plugin hook affects EVERY vendor. Regression-test the current form; do not add legacy fallbacks.
- Extension packages unscoped (`pi-open-plugin-shim`); flagship scoped (`@dk/estelle`).
- Roles run as the plugin's real `shipshape:*` subagents. The Claude dev env installs the plugin via `npx plugins add ~/shipshape`. Thin dispatches only: role, base commit, optional watchbill.
- No Claude-specific config in the repo. `.claude/` stays gitignored; role agents are the plugin's, never hand-built files.
- **Boot-verify must exercise the actual behaviour a fix claims to fix**, on the real `estelle` bin, in a directory with its own unrelated `assets/`, from the real registry. A commit landing on `main` is not evidence it shipped; check the registry version against `git log -- src/ bin/ assets/ package.json`.
- An `@eval` that seeds intent with no basis in the workspace tests incoherence, not the behaviour: seed a real project with a ready spec before driving embark.

## The crew, flagship personas

| Seat | Name | After |
|---|---|---|
| Captain | Bonny | Anne Bonny, jester mask and deadly serious, crush on Bellamy |
| Quartermaster | Misson | James Misson, true believer in the Articles |
| Crew | (roster) | Soviet space-dog survivors, names code-picked |
| Boatswain | Bellamy | "Black Sam" Bellamy, grumpy heart of gold |
| Shipwright | Johnson | Captain Charles Johnson, harbour only |

They/them, gender-neutral. Voice is honour-system; names are where code bites. Character cards in `assets/characters/`. The gender-neutral `@property` check scans `features/**` and step defs, not `assets/**`; extending it is an open candidate.

## Structural-refactor pilot charter (Phase 3)

Upstream deliberately ships no refactoring engine, no smell catalogue, no refactor role. Everything below is UNPROVEN and lives here until the pilot earns it upstream:

- **The refit engine already composes, test this first.** Perturbation + scantlings + Shipwright-reports + narrow-Crew is bounded refit today, no new role. Prove or break this composition before proposing a Carpenter.
- **Carpenter reserved, not built.** Cut the seat only if the pilot hits a wall where Crew-under-perturbation genuinely cannot carry a multi-seam refit.
- **Smells, filtered trace-not-taste.** Doctrine-worthy only if it degrades the trace: the plank-distribution family as ONE smell, plus scantling-mismatch. Drop as taste: hidden behaviour, domain plus IO mix, high churn.
- **Co-use guardrail, keep verbatim if any goes upstream.** A merge or over-split finding needs per-scenario co-use evidence, not full-run coverage.
- **Tooling stays stack-local.** ts-morph, c8, cucumber usage-json, jscpd are pilot reference, never canon.

## Parked

- Weather-record pilot: no tier records weather yet; the 0.10.1 `weather:` rigging slot standardizes where it lands. A future timeout-budget decision should rest on observed p95, not precedent-matching a sibling's number.
- Canned `assets/greeting.md` is unreferenced since `openWithBonnyVoice`; asset-custody disposition open.
