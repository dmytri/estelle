# Captain Notes

Binding behaviour lives in `.feature` specs and referenced `assets/**`. History lives in git. These notes carry only what the next cycle needs.

## What Estelle is (reoriented 2026-07-04)

Estelle is three things at once, all resting on faithfully consuming the real Shipshape plugin, never a fork of it:

1. **Reference runtime** for running Shipshape (skills + open-plugin) on pi.
2. **Live-fire pilot** that produces the evidence the maintainer's note asks for: what enforces on pi, what fumbles, every false red and vacuous green.
3. **A great coding agent** in its own right: Bonny and the crew personas, `/embark`, `/clear`, alongside-crew UX, per-seat models, fitting-out.

Estelle's earlier hand-rolled custody (`evaluateWrite`/`evaluateRead`) is wrong and is being replaced by the plugin's real custody, run through the shim.

## Monorepo

`@dk/estelle` (scoped flagship) at root; unscoped extension packages under `packages/`, consumed via `workspace:*`. One root Shipshape harness: root `cucumber.cjs`, `RIGGING.md`, `tsconfig.json` cover `packages/*`.

- `packages/pi-open-plugin-shim` — pi's open-plugin engine.
- A bespoke `pi-shipshape` is dropped: the generic install path replaces per-plugin wrappers.

## pi as an open-plugin vendor, decided operator 2026-07-05

Claude, Cursor, and codex are hook-native: the installer relocates `.plugin/` per vendor, rewrites `${...\_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, and registers it; the runtime executes. pi is not hook-native, so pi support is two pieces:

1. **Our own pi installer**, not upstream: vercel would likely ignore a contribution, so make it work for us now and consider upstreaming later. Relocate, register, rewrite the plugin-root variable.
2. **`pi-open-plugin-shim`**, the runtime engine pi lacks: read the plugin, execute hooks on pi events, run `agents/` as pi sessions, register `commands/`.

Event map: `PreToolUse` to `tool_call` (blocking); `PostToolUse` to `tool_execution_end`; `SessionStart` to `session_start`; `SessionEnd` to `session_shutdown`; `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` to the plugin directory. `SubagentStop` and the `Task` matcher (planks-check, dispatch-guard) have no pi equivalent: pi is session-isolated, not subagent-isolated. Pilot finding.

pi support is additive: the shim interprets the SAME neutral `.plugin/`; nothing changes for the other vendors.

## Standing rules

- **Pre-1.0: no backward compatibility, no compat cruft.** Current design only. Old forms are Shipwright's to refit, never a parser's to tolerate.
- A change to a SHARED plugin hook affects EVERY vendor. Regression-test the current form; do not add legacy fallbacks.
- Extension packages unscoped (`pi-open-plugin-shim`); flagship scoped (`@dk/estelle`).
- `shipshape:*` subagent types are unavailable this environment. Roles run as fresh-context general-purpose agents that load the role skill and follow it by discipline. Context bulkhead and discipline hold; the Claude-Code custody hard-gate does not fire for these.

## The crew, flagship personas to salvage

| Seat | Name | After |
|---|---|---|
| Captain | Bonny | Anne Bonny, jester mask and deadly serious, crush on Bellamy |
| Quartermaster | Misson | James Misson, true believer in the Articles |
| Crew | (roster) | Soviet space-dog survivors, names code-picked |
| Boatswain | Bellamy | "Black Sam" Bellamy, grumpy heart of gold |
| Shipwright | Johnson | Captain Charles Johnson, harbour only |

They/them, gender-neutral. Voice is honour-system; names are where code bites. Character cards in `assets/characters/`.

## Phase plan and status

1. **Shim engine and pi installer, in progress.** Done: PreToolUse write, bash, and read custody plus generic dispatch (case-insensitive matcher matching, stacked hooks), against real hook subprocesses. Next: `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolution, PostToolUse, SessionStart and SessionEnd, `commands/`, then `agents/` to pi sessions, then the pi installer.
2. **Methodology-check pilot, not started, the note's charter.** `/shipwright` refit to derive executable checks (watchbill shape, perturbation liveness, stale-plank join, forbidden-doubles scan, feature lint, tier auth probe), negative-test each (plant a violation, confirm red, remove), report the evidence.
3. **Flagship on the real foundation, not started.** Re-base Estelle onto the shim (rip out `evaluateWrite`/`evaluateRead`), salvage the flagship UX from the parked live-crew work, and fix the live-crew gaps: a visible panel, `/embark` actually running the loop, and real verification instead of the toy target.

## Upstream, ~/shipshape, human-owned

Refine only when piloting surfaces a need, under its own workflow. Committed and unpushed: `0.8.6`, one-path-per-line `## Directories` with glob custody and the Shipwright refit. The pilot's first contribution.

## Parked

The pre-reorientation live-crew stack (`/embark` alongside crew loop, heartbeat, narration, report-back) sits on `main` under the reorientation commits. Its custody guts are wrong and get replaced; its product surface (personas, `/embark`, `/clear`, per-seat models, fitting-out) is the Phase 3 salvage.
